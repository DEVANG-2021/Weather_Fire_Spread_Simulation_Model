# Effects of Weather Patterns on Forest Fire Spread

This repository contains the AnyLogic model for the project "Effects of Weather Patterns on Forest Fire Spread." This model simulates the influence of weather factors on wildfire dynamics, utilizing the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and the National Burned Area Composite (NBAC) dataset to enhance our understanding of fire behavior under different conditions.
