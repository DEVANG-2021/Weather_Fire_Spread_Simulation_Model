# Wild Fire Spread AnyLogic Simulation Model

# Effects of Weather Patterns on Forest Fire Spread

This repository contains the AnyLogic model developed for the project "Effects of Weather Patterns on Forest Fire Spread." The simulation analyzes the impact of weather factors on wildfire behavior, leveraging components of the Fire Weather Index.

## Model Overview

The model simulates wildfire spread using weather indices, such as Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Initial Spread Index (ISI), and Fire Weather Index (FWI). These indices are integrated with the National Burned Area Composite (NBAC) dataset to provide insights into fire dynamics under varying weather conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **AnyLogic Software**: Ensure AnyLogic (version X.X or later) is installed on your machine. You can download AnyLogic from [AnyLogic's official website](https://www.anylogic.com/).

### Cloning the Repository

To get a copy of the model:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEVANG-2021/Weather_Fire_Spread_Simulation_Model.git
